- 👋 Hi, I’m @BigEasyBattles
- 👀 I’m interested in improving as a programmer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning alot...

- 📫 How to reach me? Maybe something will be here when I'm half decent at this stuff
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can never get any of this crap to work honesty it's such a hassle. Github, VSCode, literally an configuration for
- any program ever, my own brain, and honestly it makes me sad. However, someday I shall imporve and seek vengence on all
- those terrible programming realted things that have brought me strife. Someday...
